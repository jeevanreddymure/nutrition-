### so,which food are best include muscle building diet
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends that bodybuilders eat 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram bodyweight each day (Caspero, 2014). For example, a 190-pound (86 kg) bodybuilder should aim for 103 to 147 grams of protein daily. Lean protein is best, as it contains relatively less saturated fat. Consider the following protein sources for a healthy bodybuilding diet.
- Chicken breast
- Egg whities
- Ground beef
- Salmon
- Canned tunna
- Mixed nuts
In addition to lean protein carbohydrates form a crirical component in building up muscles.This is because during a weight training session the body stors up glycogen to fuel the workout. Eating carbohydrates following a workout replaces this storage form of glucose, aiding recovery.
